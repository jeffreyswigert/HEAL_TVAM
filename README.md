Therapist Quality Project

This repo contains all code needed to replicate tables, figures and analysis for "Measuring the impacts of therapists: evidence from a value-added approach on an online therapy platform" by Derrick Hull, Jeff Swigert, Mitch Zufelt, et al. (2020).

Due to the proprietary nature and sensitivity of even the anonymized data, we do not store data on this repository, however, we hope to provide a synthetic sample with similar statistical properties in the future.

If you have questions, please contact jeffreyswigert@suu.edu.
